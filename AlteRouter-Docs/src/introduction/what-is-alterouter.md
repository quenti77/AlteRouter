# What is AlteRouter ?

AlteRouter is an alternative to AltoRouter. It is a routing system for PHP developers who want to create a simple and
fast router. Inspired by the project AltoRouter.

## Why use AlteRouter ?

AltoRouter is a great project, but it is no longer maintained. So I decided to create a new project based on
AltoRouter. AltoRouter needs php 5.3 or higher, but AlteRouter needs php 8.2 or higher.

I think that someone who has little experience in object-oriented programming will still be able to use the package.

## What does AlteRouter mean ?

AlteRouter means **Alter**native **Router**. It is an alternative project to AltoRouter.
